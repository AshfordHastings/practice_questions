### What is an expense ratio for a mutual fund?
<details><summary>Answer</summary>

An expense ratio is the annual fee that mutual funds or ETFs charge their shareholders for fund management and other operational costs. 

- **Gross Expense Ratio**: The total annual fund operating expenses before any fee waivers or reimbursements.
- **Net Expense Ratio**: The annual fund operating expenses after accounting for fee waivers or reimbursements.

The net expense ratio is typically lower than the gross expense ratio and reflects the actual costs investors will pay.

### What is Bid vs Ask on a Stock? 

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

The bid and ask prices on a stock are essential components of the trading process, reflecting the supply and demand for a particular security:

### Bid Price
- **Definition**: The highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a stock.
- **Implication**: Represents the demand for the stock. Buyers are hoping to purchase shares at this price.

### Ask Price
- **Definition**: The lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for a stock.
- **Implication**: Represents the supply of the stock. Sellers are hoping to sell shares at this price.

### Bid-Ask Spread
- **Definition**: The difference between the bid price and the ask price.
- **Implication**: The spread indicates the liquidity and volatility of the stock. A smaller spread generally suggests higher liquidity, meaning the stock can be bought or sold quickly with minimal price movement. A larger spread indicates lower liquidity and potentially higher volatility.

### Example
- **Bid**: $50.00
- **Ask**: $50.05
- **Bid-Ask Spread**: $0.05

### Importance
- **Trading Execution**: When you place a market order to buy a stock, it will typically be executed at the ask price. Conversely, a market order to sell a stock will be executed at the bid price.
- **Limit Orders**: You can use limit orders to specify the exact price at which you want to buy or sell, potentially setting your buy order at the bid price or your sell order at the ask price.

Understanding the bid and ask prices helps you make informed trading decisions and better understand market dynamics.

### The "bid" says 61.46 x 9, what does this mean? 

<details>

The notation "61.46 x 9" in the context of a bid price for a stock means:

- **61.46**: This is the bid price, which is the highest price that a buyer is currently willing to pay for the stock.
- **9**: This represents the number of shares (in lots) that buyers are willing to purchase at the bid price. Since stock trading typically deals with lots of 100 shares, "9" means there are orders to buy 900 shares at the bid price of $61.46.

### Interpretation
- **Bid Price**: $61.46 per share
- **Bid Size**: 900 shares (9 lots of 100 shares each)

This information helps you understand both the price and the volume of shares that buyers are currently interested in purchasing at that price.
